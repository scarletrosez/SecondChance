    Excuse me sir, i’m looking for some work
    #speaker:Anthony #portrait:anthony_neutral
    Work, huh? Not many people come in here asking for that these days. You know how to fix electronics?
    
    *[Take answer honestly]
        #speaker:Carlos #portrait:carlos_neutral
        Not really, but I can learn fast. I need a job, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes.
        #speaker:Anthony #portrait:anthony_neutral
        Well, honesty’s a good start. But this isn’t the kind of job you just ‘pick up’ overnight. It takes patience, skill, and a good eye for details.
        Why’d you come here, of all places? You seem like you’ve had some rough days.
        #speaker:Carlos #portrait:carlos_neutral
        I’ve… been through a lot. Just trying to turn things around, you know?
        #speaker:Anthony #portrait:anthony_neutral
        Alright. I can give you a few basic tasks to start. If you’re serious, show up later, and we’ll see how you do, eee..??

        Yeah, I’ve done some repairs before. Mostly small stuff. Radios, TVs, that kind of thing.
        #speaker:Anthony #portrait:anthony_neutral
        Is that so? Well, I can always use an extra set of hands. But let me tell you upfront—if you don’t know your way around a circuit board, you’ll get caught pretty quick.
        #speaker:Carlos #portrait:carlos_neutral
        I can handle it. Just give me a chance.
        #speaker:Anthony #portrait:anthony_neutral
        Alright. Show up later, and we’ll see if you can walk the talk. But I have to ask—why here? Why now? You don’t exactly look like the type who’s been fixing things all his life, eee??

        Ahh, you’re just out of prison, aren’t you?

        "*panic*", w..e..l..ll..
        #speaker:Anthony #portrait:anthony_neutral
        Well everyone deserves a second chance, you know, Show up later. Let’s see what you can do.
        #speaker:Carlos #portrait:carlos_neutral
