    #Carlos
    Excuse me sir, i’m looking for some work
    #Anthony
    Work, huh? Not many people come in here asking for that these days. You know how to fix electronics?
    
    *[Take anser honestly]
        #Carlos
        Not really, but I can learn fast. I need a job, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes.
        #Anthony
        Well, honesty’s a good start. But this isn’t the kind of job you just ‘pick up’ overnight. It takes patience, skill, and a good eye for details.
        Why’d you come here, of all places? You seem like you’ve had some rough days.
        #Carlos
        I’ve… been through a lot. Just trying to turn things around, you know?
        #Anthony
        Alright. I can give you a few basic tasks to start. If you’re serious, show up later, and we’ll see how you do, eee..??

        #Carlos
        Yeah, I’ve done some repairs before. Mostly small stuff. Radios, TVs, that kind of thing.
        #Anthony
        Is that so? Well, I can always use an extra set of hands. But let me tell you upfront—if you don’t know your way around a circuit board, you’ll get caught pretty quick.
        #Carlos
        I can handle it. Just give me a chance.
        #Anthony
        Alright. Show up later, and we’ll see if you can walk the talk. But I have to ask—why here? Why now? You don’t exactly look like the type who’s been fixing things all his life, eee??

        Ahh, you’re just out of prison, aren’t you?
        #Carlos
        "*panic*", w..e..l..ll..
        #Anthony
        Well everyone deserves a second chance, you know, Show up later. Let’s see what you can do.
        #Carlos
