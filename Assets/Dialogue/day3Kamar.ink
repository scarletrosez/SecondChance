-> day3kamar

=== day3kamar
    Three days out... And I still don’t know what direction I’m heading in. 
    Oscar’s offer... it's fast money, sure. But it’s risky—too risky. One wrong move and I could end up back in prison. I can't go through that again.
    But then there’s Anthony’s repair shop. The work is steady, honest... but slow. It's not going to be easy living on a small paycheck, especially when people still look at me like I’m nothing but a criminal.
    Whatever I choose... that’s the path I’ll be on today. 
->  DONE
