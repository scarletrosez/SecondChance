    See that guy? Iâ€™ve heard that he is changing now, he doesn't look as bad as he is when he first got into prison.

    You mean Carlos right? The one that recently got out of prison? I think I can agree with you too. I hope the time he spent in there made him a better person now.
    #speaker:womanA #portrait:womanA_neutral
    Yeah, not every criminals are that bad. Besides, I heard he robbed the bank to get money for his sick mother.
    #speaker:womanB #portrait:womanB_neutral
    Oh really??? Then he is actually a great person.
    #speaker:womanA #portrait:womanA_neutral
    Nope, we shouldn't justify him that way. He is still wrong for robbing the bank. Let's just hope not too many people gossip around about him...

    (Inside head) Heh, I'm afraid that's kinda too late lady, alot of people gossiped about me this past few days.

    (Inside head) But at least... There are this few people who understood what I went through... Thank you kind women.
